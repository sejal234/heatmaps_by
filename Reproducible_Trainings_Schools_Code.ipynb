    "## Locations of Training Programs & Schools\n",
    "This code visualizes the locations of the schools BY serves (each school that we've hosted a CTD fair) & its training programs. It will print the number of schools & trainings visualized at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you need\n",
    "You will need the pandas, folium, and geopy libraries, along with Python 3, on your computer. <br>\n",
    "I use the \"Trainings and Locations\" & \"Final 2021-2022 CTD Report\" Salesforce reports. The ones I put in this file were pulled July 2022. <br>\n",
    "For trainings, as long as there are \"Training: Training Name\", \"Location (Latitude)\", and \"Location (Latitude)\" columns, the code will work. <br>\n",
    "For schools, as long as there are \"Career Test Drive Name\" and \"School Address\" columns, the code will work. Note that the code will delete entries that do not have full addresses (and therefore not show them on the map), so ensure that the report is complete. <br>\n",
    "Export both reports as a CSV with ISO-8859 Encoding. If the column names are different, change them in my code."
